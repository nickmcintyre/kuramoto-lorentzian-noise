Global synchronization of oscillators

Example code from Bryan Daniels' [paper](http://go.owu.edu/~physics/StudentResearch/2005/BryanDaniels/kuramoto_paper.pdf). From the abstract:

> Global synchronization of oscillators is found abundantly in nature, emerging in fields from physics to biology. The Kuramoto model describes the synchronization behavior of a generalized system of interacting oscillators. With a large number of oscillators with different natural frequencies, the Kuramoto model predicts that, if they are allowed to interact strongly enough, they will all start oscillating at the same rate. The model provides a mathematical basis for studying the conditions under which synchronization can occur.
